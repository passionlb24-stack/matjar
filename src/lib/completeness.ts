// What a merchant still has to do, weighted by what it costs them to skip it.
//
// A checklist already existed: eight fixed items, identical for fifteen of the
// seventeen sectors. It is not wrong, it is just blind in the places the data
// says merchants actually stall. Measured on the live platform:
//
//   • 8 of 13 active stores have no map pin — while `location` is a default
//     module for 13 sectors, and "الأقرب إليك" cannot ship without it. The old
//     checklist never asked for one.
//   • 0 of 60 products carry a cost price — so the profit report, which is
//     built and working, computes zero for every merchant who opens it.
//
// Neither omission is visible to a merchant, because nothing ever told them.
//
// Two rules this module follows, both from hard experience elsewhere in this
// codebase:
//
// 1. A percentage must be earned, not counted. Weights are assigned by what the
//    missing thing costs — a shop with no map pin is unfindable; a shop with no
//    brand colour is merely plainer. Counting fields equally produces a number
//    that moves when nothing important changed, and merchants learn to ignore it.
//
// 2. "Complete" and "allowed to publish" are different questions. A profile can
//    be 60% complete and perfectly safe to show, or 90% complete and unsafe
//    because the one missing piece is the thing the transaction needs.
