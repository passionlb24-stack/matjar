/**
 * The professional profile engine.
 *
 * A craftsman and a freelancer are the same kind of thing — a person you are
 * deciding whether to trust with a job — and the platform had modelled them as
 * two unrelated lists. Crafts were person-first in the database and gigs were
 * not: `gigs` carries `freelancer_id` AND a denormalised `freelancer_name`, and
 * puts `rating_avg` and `completed_count` on the SERVICE rather than the
 * person. The visible consequence is that the only freelancer on the platform
 * today appears as three unconnected adverts.
 *
 * This module is the shared shape both sectors resolve into. It is deliberately
 * a data contract and a resolver, not a component: the brief's own warning is
 * against "one giant component with dozens of boolean props", and the way you
 * get that is by letting each sector pass its own flags into a shared view.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The rule that governs every field here
 *
 * Every optional field means "absent" and MUST render nothing when absent. It
 * does not mean zero, and it does not mean "show a placeholder".
 *
 * That is not a style preference on this platform, it is the reality of the
 * data. Measured 2026-08-24 on production:
 *
 *   craft_providers          0 rows      — not one craftsman exists
 *   craft_services           0
 *   craft_works (portfolio)  0
 *   craft_reviews            0
 *   craft_requests           0
 *   trades / trade_groups    47 / 9      — the taxonomy is complete
 *   gigs                     3, all three belonging to ONE person
 *   that person's profile    name only: no photo, no bio, no skills,
 *                            no languages, not verified
 *   ratings anywhere         0
 *
 * So a profile built to always show a rating, a portfolio grid, a response time
 * and an availability line renders, today, as a page of empty boxes — which is
 * worse than the list it replaced. Each block asks whether it has anything to
 * say before it says it, and the completeness prompts exist to get the person
 * to fill them in.

 * `fixed | from | hourly | per_meter | quote`. `per_unit` exists because
 * `per_meter` does: a painter quoting by the square metre was being degraded to
 * "we'll quote you", which throws away a real number the tradesman gave. It
 * carries its `unit` so "$12" can never render without "the square metre"
 * beside it — a per-unit rate shown as a flat price is the single most
 * expensive misreading on a page like this.
 *
 * `visit_fee` has NO column behind it in any table. It is a real trade

 * adds it, so treat any code path for it as unreachable rather than as a
