// ===== Matjar — Public Feature Availability =====
//
// The one place that answers "may a public page say Matjar does this?".
//
// Before this file, every marketing surface carried its own hand-written list of
// what Matjar offers, and the lists disagreed with each other and with the
// product: /pricing sold bookings as a Pro upgrade while the bookings screen is
// open on every plan; it sold profit analytics as Business while the reports
// screen (profit block included) unlocks at Pro; it listed a "verified badge" as
// an included plan feature on all three tiers while /trust says the badge has
// never been awarded to anyone; /help quoted a $12/mo Pro plan that has not
// existed since PLAN_TIERS said $25; and one row — "mobile store unit" —
// described a product that does not exist in this repository at all.
//
// Two tables live here and every public claim is rendered from them:
//
//   CAPABILITIES — what a STOREFRONT can do (the customer-facing modules of
//                  modules-catalog.ts, plus the three engine-backed surfaces the
//                  sector registry does not name: leads, stays, tickets).
//                  Drives the per-sector capability cards on /merchants.
//
//   FEATURES     — what a PLAN buys (the /pricing matrix, the tier cards, the
//                  upgrade gate, the Business-OS band).
//
// Both carry a `state`, and only `live` may be rendered as something that works.
// `beta` and `soon` must render with their state visible (see ROADMAP) — never
// as a plain tick in a comparison table. src/lib/__tests__/feature-availability
// .test.ts fails the build if a page's claim list contains anything else.
//
// The plan floors are not typed in by hand either: every entry that is backed by
// an OS module names that module, and a test asserts the floor equals the
// module's enforced `minPlan` in OS_MODULE_META — which is itself a mirror of
// the `isPro()` / `isBusiness()` guard on the screen. A page therefore cannot
// advertise a tier the code does not enforce.
//
// (Prices are NOT here. plan-tiers.ts is and stays the single source of pricing;
// this file only ever reads PLAN_TIERS for the count cells.)
