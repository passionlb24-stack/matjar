// ===== Store Experience Resolver =====
// The single source of truth for WHAT transaction surface a storefront shows.
// Historically the public store page decided this from hardcoded slug lists
// (`bookingCategories = {services, healthcare, realEstate}`) that disagreed with
// the sector registry — so sectors that declared an `appointments`/`requests`
// module never surfaced it, and sectors whose correct engine does not exist yet
// (hotels, real estate, car sales, event tickets) exposed a wrong flow (a hotel
// booked by the hour, a car sold via cart). This resolver derives the surface
// from the ENABLED MODULES + an explicit sector operational status, never from
// raw slugs, so the two can never drift again.
//
// It is intentionally a pure function (no I/O) so it is unit-testable and can be
// reused by the public store page, the product detail page, and future surfaces.

export type SectorStatus = "active" | "directory_only";

/** What the store's main items list renders as. */
export type ItemSurface =
  | "order" // cart → order (retail/food/pharmacy/farm)
  | "appointment" // BookingPanel appointment engine (clinic/salon/vet/pro)
  | "catalog"; // non-transactional list + contact (directory-only / service listings)

// Sectors whose correct transaction engine is NOT built yet. Until it is, they
// run in directory-only mode: browse + contact, never a wrong transaction.
// - hospitality: needs a date-range STAY engine (currently only hourly slots).
// - realEstate: needs a LEAD/viewing flow (currently a clinic-style appointment).
// - automotive: needed LISTING + LEAD (was sold via cart + COD).
// - events: needs TICKETING / venue date booking (currently hourly slots).
// Removing a sector from this set is a deliberate go-live decision made once its
// engine ships (see the vertical audit, files 06/12/13/15).
//
// AUTOMOTIVE LEFT THIS SET IN MJ-003, and the argument is worth writing down
// because the set is where honesty about unbuilt engines is kept.
//
// It was held here for one reason: the only transaction the platform could
// offer a car business was a cart and cash on delivery, and "add a Kia to your
// basket" is worse than no transaction at all. Migration 0298 ships the engine
// that was missing — a vehicle, a day range, a per-day price, and a btree_gist
// exclusion constraint that makes two people holding the same car on the same
// weekend impossible at the storage layer. A sector with a working transaction
// is not a directory, so keeping it here would now be the false statement.
//
// What did NOT change with it: automotive still has no CART. Renting a car and
// selling one are different transactions, and only the first one exists. So
// `canOrderProducts` stays false and isOrderSurface() still refuses automotive
// — buying is still a LEAD (test drive / offer), which is what the lead form
// (0190) is for. Half a sector going live is the accurate description, and it
// is stated in the branch below rather than implied by which set a slug is in.
