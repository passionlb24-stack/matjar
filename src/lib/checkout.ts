// What a checkout collects, computes and sends — for any store, from any page.
//
// ── Why this file exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Matjar had two checkouts. `store-products.tsx` (the store cart) collected a
// delivery zone, a coupon, a loyalty opt-in, the merchant's custom fields, a
// branch, change-for and delivery instructions, and could place a guest order.
// `product-order.tsx` (the buy box on a product page) collected none of those
// and hard-coded `p_coupon: null`, so which capabilities a customer got
// depended on which page they happened to be standing on. Migration 0229 had
// already stopped the server from UNDER-CHARGING in that case — it now raises
// `zone_required` / `below_store_minimum` instead — which turned a pricing hole
// into a dead end: on a store with delivery zones, the product page could not
// place an order at all.
//
// The fix is not to copy the cart's fields into the buy box. Two
// implementations that must agree is the condition that produced the bug, and
// a third caller (the WhatsApp order flow, a one-tap reorder, a native shell)
// will exist. So the decision — "what does a checkout for THIS store collect,
// what does it add up to, and what does it send" — lives here, once, and the
// surfaces differ only in what they put in the basket.
//
// ── What is NOT decided here ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// The server is authoritative and unchanged. `place_customer_order` /
// `place_guest_order` re-read every price from the catalogue, re-apply the
// coupon, re-cap the points and re-resolve the delivery fee, and this module
// deliberately mirrors that sequence rather than inventing one: the arithmetic
// runs through `computeTotals` in order-math.ts, which is pinned to the RPC by
// its own tests. Nothing here may change a total, a rounding rule, an order
// status or an RPC signature.
