// The point of this file is ONE test: every value the database can hand us has
// words in both languages.
//
// MP-020 shipped because nothing connected the schema to the dictionary. The
// lead statuses were written, the merchant screen used them, and the customer
// screen was handed `{}` — and every check in CI passed, because to TypeScript
// an empty `Record<string, string>` is a perfectly good `Record<string, string>`.
//
// So the enum lists below are TRANSCRIBED FROM THE SQL, by hand, with the
// migration that defines each one named next to it. That is deliberate: this
// file is a second, independent statement of what the database contains, and
// the test is the two statements being made to agree. Reading the values back
// out of the dictionary would make it agree with itself and prove nothing.
//
// When you add a status to the schema, add it here. The test will then fail
// until someone writes the Arabic, which is the entire idea.
