// ===== Which merchants are stuck, at what stage, and for how long =====
//
// Counted on production, 2026-08-21, over the 15 ACTIVE stores:
//
//   • 4 have no catalogue at all — a customer who opens them finds a page with
//     nothing on it.
//   • 11 have never had an order, a booking or a request.
//   • every order on the platform belongs to 2 stores; every booking to 1.
//   • 8 of 15 have no map pin. All 15 have a phone number.
//
// None of that appears in an audit row, a report, or the attention queue. The
// queue answers "what is waiting on me" — approvals, unanswered orders, open
// reports — and by construction a merchant who has done nothing at all is
// waiting on nobody, so the one population that never generates an event is the
// one population the dashboard cannot see. Some of these shops signed up in
// June and have not touched their catalogue since; nothing anywhere said so.
//
// Three decisions this module makes, and why:
//
// 1. STAGE, NOT SCORE. "No catalogue" and "full catalogue, no customers" are
//    different problems needing different sentences — a merchant with nothing
//    to sell must never be told to share their link, and a merchant whose shop
//    is finished must not be told to add products they already added. One
//    number would have averaged the two into a message that fits neither. The
//    ladder and its threshold are the merchant dashboard's own, read out of
//    completeness.ts rather than restated here (see CATALOGUE_TARGET).
//
// 2. A GRACE WINDOW PER STAGE. A shop that opened on Tuesday with no products
//    is not stuck, it is new; a shop that opened in June and stopped is. So a
//    store enters the list only once it has been in its stage longer than that
//    stage deserves. Without this the list is 12 rows on a platform with 15
//    stores, which is another way of saying it is not a list at all.
//
// 3. READ-ONLY, ONE TAP. Every row hands the owner a wa.me link with a
//    prefilled Arabic message he can edit before sending. Nothing here writes,
//    nothing here sends, and there is deliberately no bulk action: the value of
//    this surface is that fifteen shopkeepers get fifteen different sentences,
//    which is exactly what a broadcast destroys.

/** How far along the ladder a shop has actually got.
