// MP-010. The public review projection carries a display name and no account id.
//
// The list used to select `customer_id` so the mapper could stamp `isMine` on
// every row. No component ever read that per-row flag; the only thing derived
// from it was the single `mine` boolean below, which hides the write form from
// someone who has already reviewed this product. Shipping every reviewer's
// account id to satisfy one boolean about the viewer is the wrong way round,
// and it put a stable per-person identifier into a `select using (true)` table.
//
// So the public list no longer names the column at all, and ownership is
// answered by a separate, viewer-scoped count. A signed-out visitor — the
// common case — never issues that second query and never references
// `customer_id` in any form, which is what lets the public read survive the
// revoke.
