// Whether a whole SECTION has enough behind it to be worth linking to.
//
// Matjar ships 65 customer routes. Several of them are verticals that were
// built before the supply existed and then linked from the header dropdown, the
// phone menu, the footer and the home page regardless — so a customer in
// testing could tap "صيانة وحِرَف" from four different places and reach a
// directory with zero tradesmen in it. That is not an empty state problem; four
// entrances to nothing is the platform telling the customer it is bigger than
// it is, and they only have to be disappointed once.
//
// The rule is not new. lib/rail.ts already refuses to draw a home rail under
// three real items; this applies the SAME constant one level up, to the links
// themselves. Nothing is deleted — every route still renders, still answers its
// own URL, and still turns up in search. It simply stops being advertised until
// it can answer.
//
// The counts are public, identical for everyone, and change on the timescale of
// a merchant signing up, so they are cached across requests exactly like the
// USD rate (lib/data/settings.ts) — a page render costs zero queries almost
// always, and at worst one round trip every ten minutes platform-wide.
