// MP-039 / MP-040 / MP-041 — explicit ceilings for list fetches.
//
// PostgREST answers an unbounded `.select()` with at most `db-max-rows` (1000
// by default) and reports success. There is no error, no flag, no short-read
// signal: the array simply stops. A store with 1001 variants renders 1000 of
// them and looks fine. That failure is invisible in exactly the situation
// where it matters most — a merchant who finally grew past the ceiling.
//
// So every list fetch names its own ceiling here, and every fetch checks
// whether it came back full. A full page is not proof of truncation (a store
// with exactly 200 sections is legal), but it is the only observable the
// database gives us, and at these ceilings a false alarm is far cheaper than a
// silent one.
//
// Bounds are set comfortably above any plausible real-world value rather than
// close to today's data (36 stores / 63 products / 15 active stores), so the
// warning stays quiet until something genuinely unusual happens.
