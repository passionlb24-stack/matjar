/**
 * Freelance, resolved person-first.
 *
 * The database models this section gig-first: `gigs` carries `freelancer_id`
 * AND a denormalised `freelancer_name`, and hangs `rating_avg`,
 * `rating_count` and `completed_count` off the SERVICE. Measured on production
 * today that produces exactly one visible consequence — the only freelancer on
 * the platform ("باشن", 8b6f9cdc…) appears as three unconnected adverts, in
 * three different regions, with no thread between them.
 *
 * Nothing in the schema has to change to fix that. The person is already in
 * `profiles`; the three gigs already point at them. This module is the join the
 * pages were missing: it resolves a lister into the shared
 * {@link ProfessionalProfile} shape from `src/lib/professional.ts` so the
 * freelance profile page and the crafts profile page render through the same
 * blocks.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two rules, and they are the whole file
 *
 * 1. **Absent is absent.** `professional.ts` states it and every mapping here
 *    obeys it: a 0 completed_count becomes `null`, not `0`; a NULL rating_avg
 *    stays null; an empty `gallery` produces an empty portfolio and therefore
 *    no portfolio block. Nothing is filled in with a plausible default, because
 *    a plausible default on a trust surface is a lie the platform told.
 *
 * 2. **`profiles` is the identity, the gig copy is the fallback.**
 *    `gigs.freelancer_name` is a denormalised snapshot taken when the gig was
 *    posted. If the person renames themself, three adverts keep the old name.
 *    So the profile row wins wherever it has anything to say, exactly as
 *    `browse_gigs` already does server-side with its
 *    `coalesce(nullif(btrim(p.full_name), ''), g.freelancer_name)`.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * What is deliberately NOT mapped
 *
 * - `headline` — nothing in the schema holds one. Deriving "مصمّم" from the
 *   `design` category would be the platform putting words in someone's mouth.
 *   Their categories become `specialties`, which is a fact about their
 *   listings, and the headline stays null until they write one.
 * - `reviews` — there is no freelance review table at all. `craft_reviews`
 *   exists; nothing equivalent does here. So the array is empty, always, and
 *   the reviews block never renders.
 * - `yearsExperience`, `hours`, `trust.phoneVerified`, `trust.credentialVerified`,
 *   `trust.businessRegistered` — no columns behind any of them.
 * - The gig's cover `image_url` is NOT folded into the portfolio. It is the
 *   service's own thumbnail and the services block already shows it; copying it
 *   into a "أعمالي" grid would manufacture a portfolio out of three product
 *   photos. Only `gallery` — genuinely uploaded work samples — counts.
