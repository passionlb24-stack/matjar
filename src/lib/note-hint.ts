// What to suggest a customer might write in the note field on a product.
//
// The hint was a single string written for restaurants — "e.g. no onions, extra
// spicy". On a cotton T-shirt that is not a small mismatch: it tells the shopper
// the platform was built for someone else, on the one screen where they are
// deciding whether to trust it with an order.
//
// Only the sectors that sell something a note can meaningfully change get their
// own. The rest fall back to a neutral prompt rather than an invented one —
// a wrong example is worse than a plain one.
