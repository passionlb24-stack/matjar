  // MJ-009. A pharmacy sells stock off a shelf; a lab sells an appointment with
  // preparation instructions and a result that arrives later. They are one
  // sector here, and this bundle is the pharmacy's: cart, stock, POS, no
  // scheduling module at all. A lab filed here can only list a blood test as a
  // catalogue row with a quantity selector.
  //
  // The split is right and production is the cheapest it will ever be for it —
  // ZERO stores sit under `pharmacy` today, so nothing would be stranded. It is
  // NOT done here because a new CategoryKey is not local to this file: two
  // exhaustive `Record<CategoryKey, …>` registries live in src/lib/discovery.ts
  // (`sectorDiscovery`, `CARD_FACTS`) and one in src/components/category-icon.tsx,
  // and a key added without them fails `tsc`. A sector that half-exists is worse
  // than the conflation, so the whole add belongs in one change that owns those
  // files too.
  //
  // What IS fixed meanwhile: the sector no longer advertises itself to labs (the
  // business_types row and dict.catalog.pharmacy said "Pharmacies & labs"; see
  // migration 0300), the registry's own sample data no longer prices a lab test
  // like a box of medicine, and a service row in a sector with no `appointments`
  // module stops promising a booking it cannot honour (offering.ts). A lab today
  // belongs under `healthcare`, which already books appointments and carries
  // verifications.
