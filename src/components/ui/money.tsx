// The one way to put a price on screen.
//
// This does NOT format money — src/lib/currency.ts does, and stays the single
// source of truth for what "$1,234.57" looks like. Nor does it define the
// typography: globals.css already ships `.text-money`
// (tabular-nums + direction:ltr + unicode-bidi:isolate). What was missing was
// anything that made a caller USE both together, and the numbers say so: 66
// places render a USD amount and only 16 carry `.text-money`. Two files had
// even re-implemented the formatter locally as `formatPrice`.
//
// The two rules the class encodes, restated because they are the reason this
// component exists rather than a bare `{formatUsd(n)}`:
//
// 1. LTR isolate. "$1,200" inside an Arabic paragraph is a run of neutral and
//    number characters in an RTL paragraph, so bidi resolves it against the
//    surrounding direction: the leading "$" is a neutral and gets pushed to
//    whichever end the RTL run wants, and a range ("$10 - $20") reorders
//    outright. The isolate pins the amount to one visual order whatever text
//    surrounds it.
//
// 2. Tabular figures. Tajawal's default figures are proportional, so a column
//    of prices in a table or an order list has its decimal points wandering by
//    a digit width per row. Tabular figures give every glyph the same advance,
//    which is what makes a money column scannable.
//
// Renders a <span>. Extra props (className, title, …) pass through; wrap it
// rather than trying to render it as a <td>.
