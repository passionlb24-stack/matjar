// The switch, where the person who needs it will actually stand.
//
// Push has been wired end to end since 0049 — the secret, the site URL and pg_net
// are all configured — and there were still zero subscriptions on the whole
// platform. Not because it failed: because the only place to turn it on was the
// customer account page, which an admin waiting on store approvals never opens.
// A feature nobody can find is indistinguishable from one that does not exist.
//
// So it goes on the dashboards, and it says what it is FOR rather than "enable
// notifications" — the reason is the thing that makes someone tap it. It stays
// visible once enabled (PushOptIn turns itself into a confirmation), because on
// a phone the permission can be revoked from outside the app and a row that
// vanished would leave no way back.
