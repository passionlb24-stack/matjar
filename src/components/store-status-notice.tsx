/**
 * What a merchant sees when their shop has been suspended or refused.
 *
 * Until 0282 the only signal was a grey pill reading "معطّل" on a card, plus a
 * push that said "تواصل معنا" and nothing more. Twenty stores are suspended in
 * production and five or six of them belong to distinct real people with no
 * other store — they had no way to learn why, and neither did the admin, because
 * no reason was ever written down.
 *
 * Three rules this block follows:
 *
 *  1. Non-punitive. It states what happened and what to do next. A merchant
 *     reading it has already lost their storefront; the copy does not also
 *     accuse them.
 *  2. A NULL reason is said out loud. There is no default sentence and no empty
 *     box — "no reason was recorded, ask us" is the truth for every store
 *     suspended before there was anywhere to record one, and it is the only
 *     honest thing to print.
 *  3. The way out is one tap. supportWaLink() is the real support line, and the
 *     message is prefilled with the store's name so the person answering knows
 *     which shop is being asked about without a round-trip.
