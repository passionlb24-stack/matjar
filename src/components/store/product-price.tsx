// spans — no cart, no state, no store — so they were the part of that file that
// had no business being in a 900-line client component. They carry no
// "use client" of their own: they are imported BY client components and inherit
// the boundary, and leaving the directive off means a server component can
// render them too.
//
// Nothing about the money changed in the move. `effectivePrice` is still the
// only thing that decides what a customer pays and `formatUsd` is still the
// only thing that prints it.

 * This is the fix MJ-010 is actually about. The butcher's cards read "$7.50"
 * today, and $7.50 is what he charges for a KILO of minced beef — the unit was
 * never anywhere on the screen, in the database or in the order. Nothing about
 * the money changes here; the unit that was always implied is simply printed.
 *
 * For a unit that is not one whole kilo (say 250 g at $1.88) both are shown:
 * what you pay for one unit, and what that works out to per kilo. The second is
 * the number a shopper compares against the shop down the road, and deriving it
 * for them is the difference between an honest price and an arithmetic puzzle.
