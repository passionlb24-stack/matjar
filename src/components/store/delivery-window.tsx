// "When would you like it?", and the state that answers it.
//
// Lifted out of store-products.tsx. What came with it is the CLOCK — the awkward
// half — and what deliberately did not is the customer's answer.
//
// WHY THE ANSWER STAYS IN THE PARENT. This picker is rendered inside the
// checkout panel, which is itself inside `items.length > 0`: it unmounts the
// moment the customer empties their basket. Before the split, the chosen day and
// time lived in StoreProducts and therefore survived that, so a shopper who took
// everything out, changed their mind and put it back still had Saturday 4pm
// selected. Owning the answer down here would have quietly thrown it away — and
// worse, left the parent holding a scheduled_for the picker no longer showed.
// So the pick is a controlled value, and only the clock is local.
//
// WHY THE CLOCK IS LOCAL, and read AFTER mount rather than during render: this
// is a client component but it is still server-rendered, and
// `deliveryWindows(hours, new Date())` in the render body would be evaluated
// twice against two different clocks in two different zones — on the server (UTC
// on Vercel) and again in the browser (UTC+3 in Beirut). `daySpan` keys off
// `getDay()` and the dates are built from local parts, so the two runs can
// disagree about which slots exist and even about which DAY it is: a hydration
// mismatch on the money path. Losing `now` on unmount costs nothing, because it
// is re-read on the next mount.
//
// A DAY WITHOUT A TIME IS NOT A WINDOW. It sends nothing and the order is an
// ordinary order-now, which is what every order has been until this existed.
// The server re-checks and drops a past time regardless (0194), so a list that
// ages while the customer types is safe.
