// The switch. It is the only place in the app that triggers a notification
// permission prompt, on either platform — nothing asks on launch, and nothing
// asks after login. It is rendered inside `PushNotice`, which states in words
// what the notification is for, so by the time the OS alert appears the person

//
// That ordering is not politeness. On iOS the system alert can be shown once per
// install; a "Don't Allow" is final and cannot be re-asked from inside the app.

// Five states, because they need five different things said to them:
//
//   checking     — we do not know yet. Show the control disabled rather than
//                  nothing, so it does not pop into existence under a thumb.
//   unsupported  — this platform cannot do push (a browser without the Push
//                  API; the app shell before the FCM sender ships). Say so.
//                  Never render a button that would do nothing.
//   idle         — never asked. This is the only state that may show the prompt.
//   on           — granted and switched on. Stays visible: the permission can be
//                  revoked from outside the app, and a row that vanished when it
//                  succeeded would leave no way back.
//   off          — granted at the OS, switched off in the app. Turning it back
//                  on needs no prompt.
//   blocked      — denied at the OS. The app cannot ask again. The only honest
//                  thing to show is where the phone's own setting lives.

/**
 * One device, one channel — never two (MP-029).
 *
 * A phone that holds a Web Push subscription AND an FCM/APNs token is
 * registered twice for the same account: `push_on_notification` fans out to
 * `push_subscriptions` over VAPID, and the FCM sender (MOBILE_APP.md, still
 * unbuilt) will fan out to `device_push_tokens`. Every notification would then
 * arrive twice on the same screen, and turning it off in one place would not
 * stop the other — the switch in here only ever tears down the channel it
 * believes it is on.
 *
 * So the moment this component knows it is inside the shell, any web-side
 * registration on this device is retired: the row first — that is the thing the
 * sender reads and the only thing that actually stops delivery — then the
 * browser subscription.
 *
 * Cheap on the common path: `getSubscription()` is a local read that answers
 * null for every device that never had one, and nothing else runs.
 *
 * This is deliberately one-way. The mirror image — dropping the device token
 * when the web branch is taken — is NOT done, because `isNativeApp()` reports
 * false whenever the Capacitor import fails for any reason, and inside a real
 * app binary that would quietly delete a working FCM registration on a
 * transient failure. Losing a stale web subscription is recoverable with one
 * tap; losing the native one is not, because re-registering can need the
 * one-shot iOS prompt that has already been spent.
