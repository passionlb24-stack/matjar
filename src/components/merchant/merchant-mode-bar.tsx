// ===== Merchant mode bar =====
//
// The same human is a customer and a merchant in this app, on the same phone,
// under the same login. The customer marketplace and the merchant dashboard
// share the header shell, and on a phone — where there is no 240px rail on the
// side saying "you are running a shop" — the only thing that distinguished the
// two was which page happened to be loaded. A merchant standing behind a
// counter has to be able to tell at a glance, and so does a customer who tapped
// something wrong.
//
// So below `lg` every dashboard screen opens with this: a dark navy band that
// belongs to no other surface in the product, a «وضع التاجر» chip, the shop's
// own name, and the shop's open/closed state.
//
// ── The open/closed control is READ-ONLY, deliberately ────────────────────
//
// There is no manual open/closed switch in this database. `stores` has no
// `is_open`, no `paused`, no `accepting_orders` column — the open/closed state
// the whole platform renders (store header, /explore cards, the for-you strip)
// is DERIVED from `stores.hours` by isOpenNow(). "Closing the shop" therefore
// means editing the weekly hours grid, which lives in the store-settings form
// this component does not own and must not reach into.
//
// A switch here would have to either (a) write a column that does not exist,
// or (b) rewrite the merchant's real opening hours from a one-tap control —
// destroying the grid they configured, in order to fake a feature. Both are
// worse than saying the truth. So the state renders as the real derived status,
// it says out loud where that status comes from, and tapping it goes to the
// place that actually decides it.
//
// If a manual switch is wanted, it is a migration (`stores.is_open boolean`)
// plus a change to isOpenNow's callers — a feature, not a control.

        The navy is a fixed brand colour, not a semantic token, and this repo
        styles exclusively through tokens — there is no `dark:` variant
        configured anywhere in it (zero occurrences across src/), so `dark:`
        classes would silently do nothing. globals.css belongs to another agent,
        so the dark-theme value cannot be added as a token there either.

        React 19 hoists and de-duplicates a <style> carrying `href` +
        `precedence`, so this ships once however many times the bar renders. The
        two dark selectors mirror globals.css exactly: the media query is
        guarded with :not([data-theme="light"]) so a user who forced light on a
        dark OS keeps the light navy, and [data-theme="dark"] wins for the
        toggle. Off both, the value is the light one.
