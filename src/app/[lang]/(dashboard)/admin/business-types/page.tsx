  // or drop the option. What was wrong is that it was the ONLY consequence: the
  // row was silently filed under Shopping, the merchant saw a plausible screen,
  // and nothing anywhere ever said a mapping was missing. A default that is
  // never reported is indistinguishable from a decision, and it stays wrong for
  // as long as nobody happens to notice.
  //
  // This page is where that becomes visible, because this is where the slugs are
  // created and it is the only screen whose reader can act on it. The check is a
  // set difference against the compiled registry, so it cannot drift from what
  // the picker actually does.
  //
  // Not fixed here: the fallback at the call site in merchant/new/page.tsx, and
  // the stores already sitting in the wrong group because of it. Both are
  // outside this surface; this reports the gap rather than repairing its damage.
