// Where an email link becomes a session.
//
// Password reset was landing people straight on /reset-password, which rendered
// the form and called updateUser — with no session, because nothing had turned
// the link into one. supabase-js refuses that client-side without even calling
// the API, so the person saw a generic error, then "wrong password" at login,
// and their password had never changed. The auth logs show it exactly: /recover
// then /verify then five failed /token, and no /user request anywhere between.
//
// Two link shapes arrive here and both have to work.
//
// `token_hash` + `type` is the one to prefer, and the one the email template
// should send. It carries everything needed, so it works in whatever browser the
// person happens to open their mail in.
//
// `code` is PKCE, which Supabase's default template produces. It only works in
// the browser that ASKED for the reset, because the matching verifier was stored
// there. Someone who requests a reset in Chrome and taps the link inside the
// Gmail app is in a different browser and will fail — which is why the template
// change matters and this branch is a fallback, not the plan.
