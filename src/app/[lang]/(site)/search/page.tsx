/**
 * Search, as a screen rather than a query string with a list under it.
 *
 * One route serves both halves of the same act. With no term it is what you
 * land on when you tap search and have not decided the word yet: a field with
 * the keyboard already up, your own recent searches, and the sectors that
 * actually have stores. With a term it is the answer — and it keeps the field,
 * so correcting one letter does not mean going back out to the header.
 *
 * ONE TREE, TWO READINGS. Below `lg` this is the app's search screen: its own
 * bar with a back chevron, results grouped by KIND with the count each query
 * returned, and a way onto the map. From `lg` up it is the results page that
 * was already here, grouped by SECTOR, unchanged. Both come out of the same
 * markup on purpose — rendering the phone screen as a separate subtree would
 * put every store card and every product image into the document twice, and on
 * a phone the browser would fetch both copies.
 *
 * Two rules run through it. Nothing is a group unless it has rows: the sector
 * headings are read off the results, so "مطاعم" cannot appear above an empty
 * list, and the map link does not exist unless some result carries a pin. And
 * nothing is invented — there is no "trending" block, because the table that
 * would have to supply it holds two rows from one minute of one day.
