  // and only then, the merchant door.

  // V3 keeps that spine and puts two things in front of it, because the first
  // two questions a customer arriving on a phone actually has are narrower than
  // "what is this":
  //
  //   which half of this marketplace am I here for   → SectorGateways
  //   what can I get from it right now               → OpenNowRail
  //
  // Both sit above the nine-tile category rail rather than replacing it: the
  // gateways cover the four sectors that carry most of the intent, and the rail
  // below still covers the other five for everyone whose errand is not one of
  // those four.
  //
  // Phones and desktop read the same sequence, so the CSS `order` shuffle an
  // earlier pass needed is gone with the sections that made it necessary. What
  // does differ by width is the hero's own contents (see components/hero.tsx).
  // Everything the merchant-software pitch used to say on this page is on
  // /merchants; the FAQ is on /help; the region index is on /explore.
